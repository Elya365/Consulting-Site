#Ethos

My ethos guides my work approach, supporting the mutually beneficial relationship between myself & my clients.

How I "roll" in my role:
1. Default to transparency
2. Work smarter, not harder
3. Respect & empathy are non-negotiable
4. Help when you can, refer when you can't
5. Promote access for all; be that a search crawler, online accessibility practices, or internal stakeholders and teams
