#experience

In what can seem like an ever-evolving space, Iâ€™ve worked as a digital marketer for 9+ years. That's ages!

I'm committed to being an effective marketer that helps you and your clients. The add-value of an experienced & relevant SEO consulting partner to agencies is vital. 

Technical digital marketing is more than a strategy with no action or a tactic here and there.   

I find my flow here.

I mix experience, curiosity and a habit of self-education to give the greatest value to clients.

Working within my values is another way I perform at my best as an SEO consultant.
