#experience

I've found my flow helping with all things digital for 9+ years. In what can seem like an ever evolving space; that's ages. 

It's been a journey from:
- simple content editor to digital marketing manager with multi million dollar family owned businesses
- tackling digital management roles in emerging industries
- growth in the rapid pace of agency work
- and now as an independent **consultant**
