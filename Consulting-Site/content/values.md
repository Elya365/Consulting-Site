#Values

These are the values that guide my work. Or, how I roll in my role.

1. Default to Transparency

- Help when I can, refer when I can’t

- Be up-front about what I do and how it’s done

2. Try easier

- Apply lean principles

- Work Smarter, Not Harder

3. Respect & Empathy Are Non-negotiable

4. Be an Ally for Access

- Know and promote web accessibility best practices

- Give stakeholders access & education

- Consider the bots; write an effective robots.txt file, etc.



These guiding values empower me to deliver on the promise of being a helpful marketer and thought partner.

Here are kind words people share about their personal experience working together.
